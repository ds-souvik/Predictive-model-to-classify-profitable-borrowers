# Predictive Model to Classify Profitable Borrowers

</div>

**Project Objective**:
- The bank is facing significant financial losses due to loan defaults, which directly impacts profitability and risk management. To address this issue, the bank aims to develop a predictive model that can accurately identify borrowers who are likely to fully repay their loans versus those who are at risk of defaulting (Charged Off). By leveraging comprehensive data on loan applications, borrower demographics, and historical payment behavior, this project seeks to enhance the bank's loan approval process, minimize default rates, and optimize lending decisions.

**Ultimate Goal**:
- To improve the bank's overall financial health and customer satisfaction through data-driven insights and predictive analytics.

**Build a robust model that will predict whether the borrower will be profitable for the bank**. We have a dataset that consists of:
- Borrower’s identification data
- Borrower’s loan data
- Borrower’s demographic data
- Borrower’s verification data
- Date/ time data
- Borrower’s transaction data
- Borrower’s hardship data
- Borrower’s debt settlement data
- Borrower’s application data

**Key Steps to Achieve the Objective**:
1. **Data Quality Analysis**: Evaluate the completeness and accuracy of the dataset provided.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Focus on handling missing values and outliers to prepare the dataset for modeling.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Develop new features that can enhance the predictive power of the modeling process.
4. **Customer Segmentation**: Segment the borrowers based on various characteristics to identify patterns and group-specific behaviors.
5. **Model Development for Classification**: Build and tune models that can classify borrowers into 'profitable' or 'non-profitable' based on their likelihood to repay.
